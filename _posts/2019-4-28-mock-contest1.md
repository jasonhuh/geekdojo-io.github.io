## Review

### Last week's homework:

* Two-Sum - https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/

#### Tips on solving problems

* Read a problem statement twice! (Don't solve a wrong problem!)
* Measure twice, cut once! (Write a concrete example on a paper, write an algorithm or peusdo-code, and test the algorithm before starting to write code)
* After solving a problem, study Editorial and view solutions in Discussion.
* Upsolve - After competition, solve problems that you couldn't finish. If you do this, you are already ahead of 99% of others.

#### Cheatsheet
##### Iterating 2D list
```py
A = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]

# Iterate 2D list
for i in range(len(A)):
  for j in range(len(A[0]):
    print(A[i][j])
```

##### Hashtable
```py
from collections import defaultdict

my_dict = defaultdict(int)  # Create a dictionary where value is integer
my_dct['a'] = 1

```
